#### Oracle Service Bus
First phase is to transform Oracle Service Bus projects into Spring boot microservices



## Microservice Architecture
Loose coupling is one of the most important principles in a good microservice architecture.

## Microservice communication


Microservices loosely coupled and use both synchronous or asynchronous communication between each others.
AMPQ is used for asynchronous communication, where json is used as message format.
Synchronous communication is typically based on REST services.

## Microservice packaging
Microservice is loosely coupled to the platform and environment.

## Microservice cloud ready
Microservice is package and have n
